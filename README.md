# course-managment-system
As the front-end developer, I design a website that allows a teacher to create exams for a Python 101 course. 
The teacher is also able to edit grades for students who took the exams. 
I also designed a student page for the students to be able to take an exam assigned by the teacher. 
Once the teacher releases the grades, the student is able to view their results on the exam. 
The wesbite also offers an auto grader functionality. Which automaticly grades the exams while leting the teacher only have 
the need to finalize those grades as they see fit.
