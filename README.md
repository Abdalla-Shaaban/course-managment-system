# course-managment-system
As the front-end developer, I design a website that allows a teacher to create exams for a Python 101 course. 
Also, the teacher is able to edit grades for the students who took the exams. 
As for the students, they are be able to take an exam assigned by their teacher. 
Once the teacher releases the grades, the student is able to view their results of their exam. 
The wesbite also offers an auto grader functionality created by the team. Which automaticly grades the exams while leting the teacher only have the need to finalize those grades as they see fit.
